# HeadHunterMadness
**A collection of ridiculous quotes from head hunters**

## About
As a developer you might get messages from head hunter as well. Sometimes their messages are ridiculous. This shall be a collection of the most "special" ones.

**Feel free to use this list in your project.** Be nice and give a credit (but it's not a must).

**Feel free to contribute.** See the Contribution section below.

## The list
In the `list.json` you will find all messages. Each entry consists of:
```
{
  quote: "The ridiculous quote",
  language: ["en", "de"], // always an array, even if it's just one
  source: "LinkedIn", // a source, where the quote was found
}
```

## Anonymity 
The quotes shall not contain personal information. However, replacing a name with "XYZ" isn't funny. That's why you will find random, imaginary names in the quotes.

## Contributing)
